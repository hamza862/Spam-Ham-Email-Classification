# Spam-Ham-Email-Classification
This is a NLP project. We were required to categorize spam-ham emails.  
The Kaggle platform was used to select the dataset (spam-ham email dataset).
Additionally, the data was cleaned (missing value handling) and subjected to EDA.
Preprocessing of the text data included changing it to lowercase, eliminating stopwords and punctuation, and stemming it.
The transformed text was then vectorized to generate numerical values from the text data.
We build a model by using Naive Bayes classifier to classify the spam and ham emails and predicting the desired results.
